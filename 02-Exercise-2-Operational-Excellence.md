# Exercise 2: Operational-Excellence

## Overview

**Operational excellence** apply reliable, predictable, and automated operations processes to your architecture to keep an application running in production.

It covers the operations and processes that keep an application running in production. Deployments must be reliable and predictable. Automate deployments to reduce the chance of human error. Fast and routine deployment processes won't slow down the release of new features or bug fixes.



### Task 1: DevOps

To activate resources on demand, deploy solutions rapidly, minimize human error, and produce consistent and repeatable results, we should automate deployments and updates. Complex issues may not always be able to be identified in a timely manner. However, with good automation, the detection of these issues should occur quickly.
 
Once a process is automated, training and maintenance can be greatly reduced or eliminated. This frees engineers to spend less time on manual processes and more time on automating business solutions.

The different types of automation include:

#### 1. Infrastructure deployment:

As businesses move to the cloud, they need to repeatedly deploy their solutions and know that their infrastructure is in a reliable state. To meet these challenges, you can automate deployments using a practice referred to as infrastructure as code. In code, you define the infrastructure that needs to be deployed.

-There are many deployment technologies you can use with Azure. Here are three examples that use the declarative approach:

 * Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates
 * Azure Bicep
 * Terraform


#### 2. Infrastructure configuration

If you don't manage configuration carefully, your business could encounter disruptions such as system outages and security issues. Optimal configuration can enable you to quickly detect and correct configurations that could interrupt or slow performance.

- When creating new resources on Azure, you may take advantage of configuration as code to bootstrap the deployment.

- Configuration tools can also be used to configure and manage the ongoing state of deployed resources.

#### 3. Operational tasks

As the demand for speed in performing operational tasks increases over time, you are expected to deliver things faster and faster. Manually performing operational tasks will fail to scale as demand increases. This is where automation can help. 

To meet on-demand delivery using an automation platform, you need to develop automation components (such as runbooks and configurations), create integrations to systems that are already in place efficiently, and operate and troubleshoot.

The advantages of automating operational tasks include:

 * Optimize and extend existing processes.
 * Deliver flexible and reliable services.
 * Lower costs.
 * Improve predictability.


### Task 2: Deployment

In this task, you will learn to deploy and implement Azure Policy using the ARM Template. Here, you will be working with the "Add a tag to resources" policy. You can add tags to your Azure resources as metadata items. They are key-value pairs that help you in finding resources based on conditions that matter to your organization. 

Adding a tag to the resources policy puts tags on resources that are newly created under your subscription/resource group. For existing resources, you can remediate those by triggering a remediation task. In addition, you will see how to run remediation tasks for existing resources in your workload.

1. In the Azure search box, enter **Deploy a custom template** and select it.

### Task 3: Monitor 

In this task, you will be creating an automated workflow that integrates two services, an RSS feed for a website and an email account using a logic app. The RSS connector has a trigger that checks an RSS feed, based on a schedule. The Office 365 Outlook connector has an action that sends an email for each new item.

After you create and run a Consumption logic app workflow, you can check that workflow's run status, trigger history, runs history, and performance. To get notifications about failures or other possible problems, set up alerts. In this task we will perform all the operations such as creating alerts, checking on the run status, and trigger history.

### Task 4: Configure Azure Automatic VM guest OS patching 

Enabling automatic VM guest patching for your Azure VMs helps ease update management by safely and automatically patching virtual machines to maintain security compliance.

 - Patches categorized as Critical or Security are downloaded and installed on the VM automatically.
 - Azure oversees patch orchestration, and availability-first principles are used to apply patches.
 - Patches are installed during off-peak times in the time zone of the VM.
 - Patching failures are tracked by monitoring virtual machine health, as defined by platform health signals.
 - Ideal for all VM sizes.

In this task, you will learn how to enable Azure Automatic VM guest OS patching.

1. In the Azure portal, select the Azure **Cloud Shell** icon from the top menu.

   ![](./media/costupd-12.png)

2. In the Cloud Shell window that opens at the bottom of your browser window, select **PowerShell**.

   ![](./media/costupd-13.png)

3. After a moment, a message is displayed that you have successfully requested a Cloud Shell, and you are presented with a PS Azure prompt.

   ![](./media/costupd-04.png)

4. Copy the following command into a text editor to enable automatic VM guest patching for your Azure virtual machines. Here we will work with the **wafproxxxxdc** virtual machine from the **wafprod** resource group.

   ```
   az vm update --resource-group [resource group name] --name [virtual machine name] --set osProfile.windowsConfiguration.enableAutomaticUpdates=true osProfile.windowsConfiguration.patchSettings.patchMode=AutomaticByPlatform
   ```

5. Replace **[resource group name]** and **[virtual machine name]** with **wafprod** and **wafproxxxxdc** virtual machine name, respectively. The command will look similar to the one below.

   ```
   az vm update --resource-group wafprod --name wafprok4syndc --set osProfile.windowsConfiguration.enableAutomaticUpdates=true   osProfile.windowsConfiguration.patchSettings.patchMode=AutomaticByPlatform
   ```

   > **Note:** Virtual Machine name will be different for you, as the one in the above command is just for example.

6. Paste the command and hit enter. You will see the output once the command is executed successfully.

   ![](./media/op-upd-11.png)

7. To verify whether automatic VM guest patching has been completed and the patching extension is installed on the VM, you can review the VM’s instance view. Copy the below command in the text editor.

   ``` 
   az vm get-instance-view --resource-group [resource group name] --name [virtual machine name]
   ```

8. Replace **[virtual machine name]** with your virtual machine's name. The command will look similar to the one below.

   ```
   az vm get-instance-view --resource-group wafprod --name wafprok4syndc
   ```

   > **Note:** Virtual Machine name will be different for you, as the one in the above command is just for example.

9. Paste the command and hit enter. You will see the output once the command is executed successfully.

   ![](./media/op-upd-12.png)

10. Scroll down to view patch settings in windows configuration. It shows that automatic updates are enabled now.

    ![](./media/op-upd-13.png)

### Task 5: Processes and Cadence (Read-only task)

Anytime you create a project, you must choose a process or process template based on the process model selected for your organization or collection. The work-tracking objects contained within the default processes and process templates are Basic, Agile, CMMI, and Scrum.

Basic is the most lightweight and is in a selective Preview. Scrum is the next most lightweight. Agile supports many Agile method terms, and CMMI, which stands for Capability Maturity Model Integration, provides the most support for formal processes and change management.

You can always choose the process that provides the best fit for your team.

#### Basic:

- Choose **Basic** when your team wants the simplest model that uses Issues, Tasks, and Epics to track work.

   ![](media/basic-process-epics-issues-tasks-2.png)

#### Agile:

- Choose Agile when your team uses Agile planning methods, including Scrum, and tracks development and test activities separately.

- This process works great if you want to track user stories and (optionally) bugs on the Kanban board, or track bugs and tasks on the taskboard.


   ![](media/alm_pt_agile_wit_artifacts.png)

#### Scrum:

- Choose Scrum when your team practices Scrum. This process works great if you want to track product backlog items (PBIs) and bugs on the Kanban board or break down PBIs and bugs into tasks on the taskboard.

   ![](media/alm_pt_scrum_wit_artifacts.png)


#### CMMI:

- Choose CMMI when your team follows more formal project methods that require a framework for process improvement and an auditable record of decisions. With this process, you can track requirements, change requests, risks, and reviews.

- This process supports formal change management activities. Tasks support tracking Original Estimate, Remaining Work, and Completed Work.
