# Exercise 1: Cost Optimization

## Overview

Cost Optimization is the process of managing costs to maximize the value delivered. The **Cost Optimization** pillar provides principles for balancing business goals with budget justification to create a cost-effective workload while avoiding capital-intensive solutions. Cost optimization is about looking at ways to reduce unnecessary expenses and improve operational efficiencies.

The **Cost Optimization** in a Well-Architected Assessment, is a top-down review of your workload to identify what could be improved in your architecture. In this exercise, we will begin by looking at the costs of the workload as well as the most prevalent pain points and how to address them.

This will help with the most immediate and direct impact of the recommendations.

### **Task 1: Monitor and Forecast**

In this task, you will learn how to monitor the cost of a workload with Azure Cost Management and Billing.


**Cost Management and Billing** significantly improve the technical performance of your business workloads. It can also reduce your costs and the overhead required to manage organizational assets. Cost Management is a suite of tools provided by Microsoft that helps you analyze, manage, and optimize the costs of your workloads. 

With advanced analytics, Cost Management reveals corporate cost and use patterns. The usage-based charges incurred by Azure services and third-party Marketplace offerings are displayed in Cost Management reports.

1. In the Azure portal, click on **Show portal menu (1)** and select **Cost Management + Billing (2)**.

   ![](./media/costopt-28.png)
   
2. Now select **Cost Management**.

   ![](./media/costopt-29.png)

3. You will be directed to the Overview page. Once there, select **Cost analysis** present under _Cost Management_.

   ![](./media/costopt-32.png)
   
4. The initial cost analysis view includes the following areas:

    * **Currently selected view:** This represents the predefined cost analysis view configuration. Each view includes date range, granularity, group by, and filter settings. The default view shows the current billing period's total combined costs, but you can switch to one of the other built-in views.

    * **Cost (1):** Shows the total usage and purchase costs for the current month, as they're accrued and will appear on your bill. Costs are estimated until the invoice is generated and do not factor in credits. Pay-as-you-go subscriptions only include usage costs.

    * **Forecast (2):** Shows the total forecasted costs for the time period you choose. The Forecast is based on usage for the selected time period and does not account for purchases. Changes in usage may take up to a week to be reflected.

    * **Budget (if selected) (3):** Shows the planned spending limit for the selected scope, if available.

    * **Accumulated granularity (4):** Shows the total aggregate daily costs from the beginning of the billing period. You can easily monitor your spending trend versus the budget after creating a budget for your billing account or subscription. Hover over a date to view the accumulated cost for that day.

    * **Pivot (donut) charts (5):** These charts provide dynamic pivots, breaking down the total cost by a common set of standard properties. They show the largest to smallest costs for the current month.

    ![](./media/costopt-31.png)

   > **Forecast:** Cost forecasts display a projection of your projected costs for the given time period based on your recent spending. You can see when the forecasted spending is going to exceed the budget threshold if you put up a budget in Cost analysis. For up to a year, the prediction model can anticipate future costs.

5. You can play with the different filters provided here to analyze the cost, such as:

   * **View:** Cost analysis has four built-in views; they are as follows:
      1. **Accumulated cost -** How much have I spent so far this month? Will I stay within my budget?
      2. **Daily cost -** Have there been any increases in the cost per day for the last 30 days?
      3. **Cost by service -**	How has my monthly usage varied over the past three invoices?
      4. **Cost by resource -**	Which resources cost the most so far this month?
      5. **Invoice details -**	What charges did I have on my last invoice?

      ![](./media/costopt-33.png)
 
 
   * **Date Range:** Here you can select custom dates as well as time periods for a better and deeper analysis.
      1. By default, the current month's data is displayed in cost analysis. Switch to common date ranges fast by using the date selector.
      2. Examples include the last seven days, the last month, the current year, or a custom date range.   

       ![](./media/costopt-34.png)

   * **View Cost:** To have better visibility on cost, you can use different views given below: 
      1. **Group by:** _Group by_ uses common properties to break down costs and identify top contributors. From the drop-down, you can select a group by keys such as Tag, Resource type, Provider, etc. 
      2. **Granularity:** This view is optimized to show how you're trending against a budget for the selected time range.
      3. **Graph type:** It asks for a graphical representation, and what kind of representation you prefer. It could be Table, Column, Line, and much more.

 The image below shows _**Group by Resource type, Granularity: Daily and Graph type: Column(Stacked)**_

   ![](./media/costopt-35.png)

6. You can export cost data to a CSV file to do a cost analysis.

7. In the **Cost Analysis (1)** section, click on **Cost by resource (2)** drop down and select **Resource groups(preview) (3)**.

    ![](./media/costupd-16.png)

### **Task 2: Shutdown**

Use the Start/Stop VMs during the off-hours feature of virtual machines to minimize waste. The feature is suitable as a **low-cost automation** option. There are many configuration options to schedule the start and stop times. 

Some ways to Start and Stop VMs are:
* From the Azure portal, by going to each VM and start/stop it manually.
* Using PowerShell/CLI
* Enabling Auto shutdown for a VM
* Using Azure Automation

With respect to the workload we have, we will use Automation Accounts to perform the Start/Stop operation.

1. In the Azure portal, click on **Show portal menu (1)** and select **Resource groups (2)**.

   ![](./media/costopt-01.png)

      > **Note:** Click on **Refresh** if the VMs don't reflect the latest status.


### **Task 3: Resize the Azure resources**


#### **Subtask 1: Virtual machine**
 
You can lower the cost by managing the size of the VMs. VM insights monitor the performance and health of your virtual machines including their running processes and dependencies on other resources. It can help deliver predictable performance and availability of vital applications by identifying performance bottlenecks and network issues. 
 
VM Insights show the following utilization charts shown on the **Performance** page:

* CPU Utilization % - shows the processor utilization of the virtual machine. 
* Available Memory - shows the amount of available memory in the virtual machines. 
* Logical Disk Space Used % - shows the disk space used % across all disk volumes in the virtual machine.
* Bytes Sent Rate - shows the highest average of bytes sent through the virtual machine.
* Bytes Receive Rate - shows the highest average of bytes received through the virtual machine.
 
1. Search for virtual machines in the Azure portal and select **Virtual Machines**.
   
   ![](./media/insights01.png)

2. Select the virtual machine with the name **wafproxxxdc** from the wafprod resource group.

   ![](./media/insights02.png)

   > **Note:** Please make sure you select the virtual machine with the name **wafproxxxdc** and that it is in a running state. If not please click on **Start** to start the virtual machine.

3. Click on **Insights** under minitoring and select **Enable**.

   ![](./media/insights03.png)

4. On the **Monitoring configuration** page, leave all the values to default and click on **Configure**.

   ![](/media/EX1-Task3-ST1-step4a.png)

5. On the **Insights** page observe the performance under **Monitoring** section.

   ![](./media/insights1.gif)
  
      > **Note:** It can take between 5-10 minutes to configure the virtual machine and for the monitoring data to appear.
 
6. Select **Size** present under _Settings_ pane.

   ![](/media/EX1-Task3-ST1-step6.png)
   
7. From the list of available sizes, click on **B1s** size to select it and then click on the **Resize** button.

   ![](./media/costopt-04.png)

    > **Note:** B-series burstable VMs are ideal for workloads that do not need the full performance of the CPU continuously, like web servers, small databases & development, and test environments. The B-Series provides these customers the ability to purchase a VM size with a _**price-conscious baseline performance**_ that allows the VM instance to build up credits when the VM is utilizing less than its base performance. When the VM has accumulated credit, the VM can burst above the VM’s baseline using up to 100% of the CPU when your application requires higher CPU performance.

8. Go back to the **Overview** page and verify the VM size. 

   ![](./media/costopt-05.png)

    > ⭐ Good to know: <br>
   > For a D2s_v3 which has 2 vCPUs and 8 GiB of memory the hourly rate is $0.227 per hour (monthly $163.83) and for B1s with 1 vCPU and 1 GiB memory the rate is $0.031 per hour (monthly $21.85). This results in savings!
 
   > You can follow the same process to resize all the virtual machines in your workload, to optimize the cost.


 #### **Subtask 2: Storage Account** 
 

1. In the Azure portal, type **Storage account** in the search box and then select it from the suggestions.

   ![](media/storage01.png)
   
2. Select the storage account with the name **wafdevxxxstorage**, that falls under **wafdev** resource group.

   ![](media/storage02.png)
 
3. On the **Overview** page of the storage account, observe the configuration of the storage account.

    ![](media/storage03.png)

   > **Note:** observe that the storage account is in GRS replication which saves the data synchronously three times at the primary physical location (LRS) and asynchronously three times in a secondary physical region. We will be converting this to LRS replication which stores data synchronously three times at one physical location to optimize the cost.

4. Scroll down on the left navigation pane and select **Redundancy** under Data management.

    ![](media/Redundancy1.png)

5. Select **Locally-redundant storage (LRS)** under **Redundancy** and click on **Save** to save the changes.

   ![](media/Redundancy2.png)
 
 
 
 #### **Subtask 3: Networking**
 
 * VPN gateway is recommended for development/test cases or small-scale production workloads where throughput is less than 100 Mbps. Use ExpressRoute for enterprise and mission-critical workloads that access most Azure services. You can choose bandwidth from 50 Mbps to 10 Gbps.

* Another consideration is security. Unlike VPN Gateway traffic, ExpressRoute connections don't go over the public internet. VPN Gateway traffic is secured by industry-standard IPsec.

* For both services, inbound transfers are free and outbound transfers are billed per the billing zone.
 
* Azure front door and express route are expensive, whereas the VPN gateway is cheaper.
 
* By using the [Azure Pricing Calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/calculator/), you can calculate the cost of a VPN gateway and observe how the cost varies by changing the type and size of outbound data transfer.
 
   ![](media/VPN01.png)



### **Task 4: Cost controls**

In this task, you will learn about Budgets and Alert in Azure that help to analyze and optimize the cost in a better way.

There is an alert feature in Azure Cost Management. When consumption reaches a critical threshold, an alert is sent out. Consider the metrics that each workload resource produces. For each metric, build alerts on baseline thresholds. 

This way, the admins can be alerted when the workload is using the services at capacity. Admins can then fine-tune the resources to target specific SKUs based on current demand. You can also set budget alerts at the scopes of resource groups and management groups. Both cloud services performance and budget requirements can be balanced through alerts on metrics and budgets.

1. In the Azure portal, search for Subscriptions and select **Subscriptions** from the suggestions.

   ![](./media/costopt-38.png)

2. Select your default subscription and then select **Budgets**.

   ![](./media/costopt-39.png)

3. Click on **+ Add** to add a budget.

   ![](./media/costopt-40.png)

4. Fill in the Budget Details as follows:

   * **Scope:** Make sure your subscription is selected **(1)**.
   * **Name:** Enter **waf-budget (2)** in the name block.
   * **Reset period:** The reset period determines the time window that's analyzed by the budget. Select **Quarterly (3)** from the drop-down.
   * **Creation date:** This is the date of creation of the budget and it will be selected by default **(4)**.
   * **Expiration date:** Add an expiry date for the budget **(5)**.
   * **Amount ($):** Enter the **Suggested budget (6)** given just below the Amount field.
   * Click on **Next (7)**.

   ![](./media/costupd-19.png)

5. Add two **Alert conditions** as given below:

   * **(1)** Type: Select **Actual** from the drop-down.
   * % of budget: Add the desired percentage here. (Actual costs budget alerts are generated for the actual cost you've accrued in relation to the budget thresholds configured. As an example, in the screenshot below, an email alert gets generated when 90% of the budget is reached.)

   * **(2)** Type: Select **Forecasted** from the drop-down.
   * % of budget: Add the desired percentage here. (Forecasted alerts provide advanced notification that your spending trends are likely to exceed your budget. As an example, in the screenshot below, an email alert gets generated when the 100% forecasted budget threshold is met.)

   * Once done, click on **Manage action group (3)**. and then select **+ Create**.

   ![](./media/costopt-47.png)

### **Task 5: Azure Hybrid Benefit**

In this task, you will get to know about Azure Hybrid Benefit.

**1. What is the Azure Hybrid Benefit?**

* Customer workloads are becoming more complicated, with several apps running on various hardware platforms across on-premises, multi-cloud, and the edge. It's critical to succeed in managing these various workload designs, providing uncompromised security, and allowing developers to be more agile.

* Azure gives you the flexibility to innovate anywhere in your hybrid environment while operating seamlessly and securely.

* **The Azure Hybrid Benefit is a pricing offer that helps you maximize the value of your existing on-premises Windows Server and/or SQL Server license investment while you’re migrating to Azure.** With it, eligible customers pay a reduced rate on Azure Virtual Machines (Infrastructure as a service, or IaaS) and a reduced rate on Azure SQL Database (platform as a service, or PaaS) and SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines (IaaS).

**2. Which products are eligible for the Azure Hybrid Benefit?**

* Windows Server Standard Edition with Software Assurance
* Windows Server Datacenter edition with Software Assurance
* SQL Server Enterprise Core with Software Assurance
* SQL Server Standard Core with Software Assurance
* Azure SQL Database

**3. How many Azure virtual machines will one receive with on-premises licenses?**

For every 2-processor Windows Server license or set of 16 core Windows Server licenses covered with Software Assurance, you’ll receive either of the following in Azure.

* Up to 2 virtual machines with up to 8 cores
* One virtual machine with up to 16 cores

**4. What benefit does this offer for Windows Server on Azure Virtual Machines?**

Azure Hybrid Benefit helps you get more value from your Windows Server licenses and save up to 40 percent* on virtual machines.

Each 2-processor license or each set of 16-core licenses, Datacenter or Standard Editions, are entitled to two instances of up to 8 cores, or one instance of up to 16 cores. Datacenter Edition licenses allow for simultaneous usage both on-premises and in Azure. Standard Edition licenses must be used either on-premises or in Azure, although customers get 180 days of concurrent use rights while they are migrating their servers.


**5. Who is eligible for this offer?**

The Azure Hybrid Benefit for SQL Server is available to customers with either of the following:

* SQL Server Enterprise Core with Software Assurance or qualifying subscription licenses

This hybrid benefit is only available for use with:

* vCore-based service tiers of Azure SQL Database: Managed Instance, Single Database, and Elastic Pool
* SQL Server in Azure Virtual Machines
* SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS)

### **Task 6: Reserve Instances**

**1. What is Azure Reservation?**

  By committing to one-year or three-year agreements for several goods, Azure Reservations can help you save money. Committing allows you to get a discount on the resources you use. When compared to pay-as-you-go charges, reservations can save you up to 72 percent on your resource costs. Reservations provide a billing discount and don't affect the runtime state of your resources.
  
  You can pay for a reservation in advance or on a monthly basis. The overall cost of up-front and monthly reservations is the same, and there are no additional costs if you pay monthly. Azure reservations, but not third-party items, can be paid monthly.

**2. Why should you opt for an Azure reservation?**

  If you have constant resource usage that supports reservations, purchasing a reservation can help you save money. Pay-as-you-go prices apply when you frequently run instances of a service without making a reservation. When you buy a reservation, you immediately get the reservation discount. Pay-as-you-go charges are no longer applied to the resources. 

**3. Which Resources are Most Appropriate for Azure Reservations?**

  Following are the resources that fall under Reservations:
  
 * App Service
 * Azure Cache for Redis
 * Cosmos DB
 * Databricks
 * Data Explorer
 * Disk Storage
 * Dedicated Host
 * Software plans
 * Storage
 * SQL Database
 * Azure Database for PostgreSQL
 * Azure Database for MySQL
 * Azure Database for MariaDB
 * Azure Synapse Analytics
 * Virtual machines
 * Log Analytics


**4. Virtual Machine size flexibility with Reserved VM Instances**

  You can select to optimize, for instance, size flexibility or capacity priority when purchasing a Reserved VM Instance. The reservation you purchase is valid for all sizes of virtual machines (VMs) in the same instance size flexibility group. 
  
  The number of VMs that the reservation discount applies to inside the instance size flexibility group is determined by the VM size you choose when you acquire a reservation. It also relies on the size of the virtual machines (VMs) you're operating. The relative footprint for each VM size in that instance size flexibility group is compared in the ratio column. Calculate how the reservation discount applies to the VMs you have running using the ratio value.

  For example, if you buy a reservation for a VM size that's listed in the DSv2 Series, like Standard_DS3_v2, the reservation discount can apply to the other sizes that are listed in that same instance size flexibility group such as Standard_DS1_v2, Standard_DS2_v2, Standard_DS3_v2 and so on.
  
  But that reservation discount doesn't apply to VMs sizes that are listed in different instance size flexibility groups, like SKUs in DSv2 Series High Memory: Standard_DS11_v2, Standard_DS12_v2, and so on.


**Example:** The following examples use the sizes and ratios in the DSv2-series table.

You buy a reserved VM instance with the size Standard_DS4_v2 where the ratio or relative footprint compared to the other sizes in that series is 8.

* Scenario 1: Run eight Standard_DS1_v2 sized VMs with a ratio of 1. Your reservation discount applies to all eight of those VMs.
* Scenario 2: Run two Standard_DS2_v2 sized VMs with a ratio of 2 each. Also, run a Standard_DS3_v2 sized VM with a ratio of 4. The total footprint is 2+2+4=8. So, your reservation discount applies to all three of those VMs.
* Scenario 3: Run one Standard_DS5_v2 with a ratio of 16. Your reservation discount applies to half that VM's compute cost.
* Scenario 4: Run one Standard_DS5_v2 with a ratio of 16 and purchase an additional Standard_DS4_v2 reservation with a ratio of 8. Both reservations combine and apply the discount to the entire VM.

The following sections show what sizes are in the same size series group when you buy a reserved VM instance optimized for instance size flexibility.  
  
**5. Analysis:**
 
 All reservations except Azure Databricks are applied hourly. To ensure reservations help reduce costs, you should purchase them based on an analysis of consistent baseline usage.
 
 If you purchase more capacity than was previously used, your reservation may be underutilized. You should try to get the most out of reservations because unused reservations cannot be saved for later use. Additionally, if your usage exceeds the reserved capacity, you will be charged the pay-per-use rate. 
 
Azure provides automated reservation recommendations. These are calculated by analyzing your hourly usage data over the past 7, 30, and 60 days. Azure calculates the cost of the reservation and compares it to the actual pay-as-you-go cost incurred during the period. Then, Azure recommends the quantity that can maximize savings.
 
 For example, if the workload uses 100 VMs regularly, but occasionally demands spikes to 150, Azure will calculate potential savings for a reservation of 100 VMs as well as 150. If the demand spikes are infrequent, the calculation may determine that you can save by purchasing 100 reserved VMs. However, if demand spikes are very common, it may recommend reserving more than 100 VMs to save costs. 

There are a few things to keep in mind regarding automated reservation recommendations:

* The reservation recommendation is calculated using the pay-as-you-go rates relevant to your use case.
* Recommendations are based on individual VM sizes and do not apply to the entire size family.
* After you commit to a reservation, on the same day of the purchase, the recommended quantity for the scope is reduced. In other words, the reserved VMs are no longer considered part of the resources eligible for reservation.

 
**6. Scope:**
 
 Note that only Enterprise Agreements, Pay-As-You-Go Subscriptions, and Microsoft Customer Agreement Subscriptions support reservations.
 
 **Reservation Scope Options:**
 
* Single resource group scope— this means the reservation discount is only applied to matching resources in a specific Azure resource group.
* Single subscription scope— this means a reservation discount is applied to matching resources in an entire Azure subscription.
* Shared scope— lets you apply reservation discounts to matching resources used by multiple eligible subscriptions connected to the same billing scope, which can include more than one Azure subscription.


**7. Savings Plan:**

Your hourly usage data from the last 7, 30, and 60 days is used to determine the best savings plan purchases. Azure estimates the costs you would have incurred if you had a savings plan and compares them to the real pay-as-you-go charges you actually experienced over the time period. Every quantity you used throughout the time period is factored into the computation. It is advised to make a commitment at a level that will optimize your savings.

For example, your consumption may fluctuate between 50 and 70 virtual machines at times. Azure determines your savings in this example for both the 50 and 70 VM amounts. The recommendation computation indicates that savings are maximized for a savings plan commitment large enough to cover 50 VMs because the 70 VM utilization is intermittent, and the suggestion is given for that commitment.

Note the following points:

- Recommendations for savings plans are generated using your personal on-demand usage rates.
- Calculating recommendations does not use the instance size family; rather, it uses individual sizes.
- On the same day that you purchase a commitment for a scope, the recommended commitment for that scope is decreased.
- However, it may take up to 25 days to update the suggestion for the commitment amount across scopes. For instance, if you base your purchase on shared scope suggestions, it may take up to 25 days for the single subscription scope recommendations to go down.
- Azure doesn't produce recommendations at this time for the management group scope.

### **Task 7: Move to PAAS**

Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) and platform as a service (PaaS) is cloud service models.

* IaaS provides users with remote access to computing resources such as servers, storage, and networks. This infrastructure is hosted and managed by the IaaS provider. Customers access hardware and resources over the internet.

* PaaS, on the other hand, provides a framework for creating and implementing apps. 

* In the same way, as IaaS hosts and maintains the platform's servers, networks, storage, and other computing resources, PaaS hosts and maintains the platform's servers, networks, storage, and other computing resources. 

* However, PaaS also covers tools, services, and systems that aid in the development of web applications. The platform allows developers to create apps without having to worry about backups, security, upgrades, or other administrative responsibilities. 

* The infrastructure cost is incorporated in the service pricing model with PaaS. For example, you can provide a lower SKU virtual machine as a jump box. Storage and managing a separate server come at an added cost. On the virtual machine, you must additionally configure a public IP address, which is not suggested. All of these expenditures are taken into account by a managed service like Azure Bastion, which provides improved protection.

* Use PaaS instead of IaaS wherever possible. IaaS is similar to owning a box of spare parts. You can construct anything, but you must put it together yourself. PaaS alternatives are simpler to set up and manage. Virtual machines (VMs) and virtual networks are not required. You also won't have to deal with routine maintenance such as installing patches and updates.

Here's an architecture of the workload on both IaaS and PaaS:
